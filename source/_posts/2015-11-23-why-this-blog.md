<p>At this point BIP 101 was released around 4 months ago and the second ‘Scaling Bitcoin Conference’ is 2 weeks away.</p>

<p>There is an active debate about the direction of Bitcoin and I have many new thoughts about the economic and political issues, that I want to contribute to the debate. I want maximum exposure for these view, hence my starting this blog.</p>

<p>I will also be writing technical posts related to digital currencies. I will not be adding anything new here as there are many people with vastly greater knowledge.</p>

<p>My aim with technical posts is to improve my understanding, and the guides might prove useful to other people with similar educational aspirations.</p>
