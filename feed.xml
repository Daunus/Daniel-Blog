        <title>Why This Blog?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point BIP 101 was released around 4 months ago and the second ‘Scaling Bitcoin Conference’ is 2 weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an active debate about the direction of Bitcoin and I have many new thoughts about the economic and political issues, that I want to contribute to the debate. I want maximum exposure for these view, hence my starting this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be writing technical posts related to digital currencies. I will not be adding anything new here as there are many people with vastly greater knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aim with technical posts is to improve my understanding, and the guides might prove useful to other people with similar educational aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
